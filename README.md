# LineageOS 15 releases for galaxy a5 SM-A500FU.

Releases are uploaded monthly according to my jenkins builds, if they don't get any build errors

Since google usually releases security updates before the 10th day of every month, builds are scheduled for the 10th day of every month

Releases can be found at https://github.com/DeadSquirrel01/lineage-15_a5_releases/releases

This project is discontinued. This means the final build is the 20180210 one, and releases won't be published anymore.
